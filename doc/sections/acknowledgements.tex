\chapter{Acknowledgements}

First and foremost I would like to thank my supervisors, Marie E. Rognes, Kent-Andre Mardal for providing guidance and expertise throughout this Master's thesis. I am also very grateful for the time and patience that Travis Thompson has offered during the completion of the thesis; you always made time to answer my questions and motivate me to do my best. Also, I would like to thank Simula Research Laboratory for allowing me to work on an inspiring project as well as organizing an amazing summer school. Finally, I would like to thank my family and friends for the support.
